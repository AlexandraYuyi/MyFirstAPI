"""In this example, the differential equation is defined in the function f(t, y). The initial conditions are defined as t0 and y0. The step size h and number of steps n are also defined. The arrays for t and y are initialized with zeros, and the initial values are set. The Euler method is then used to solve the differential equation, and the results are plotted using Matplotlib."""
